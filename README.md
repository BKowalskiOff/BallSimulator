# BallSimulator
A simple Java desktop app that lets it's user simulate a bouncy ball in an uniform gravitational field.\

Originally, i made this project using Java Swing library for the purpose of helping my friend with his studies project. Now, as a free time activity, my aim is to rebuild it using JavaFX to get 
familiar with this framework and extend the simulator's functionalities.
